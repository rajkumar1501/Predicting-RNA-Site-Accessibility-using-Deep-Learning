# Predicting RNA Site Accessibility using Deep Learning

##### A proposed model for predicting accessible and bound residues RNA.

#### **For Coustom Prediction change the** 'seq' **variable at *line no. 95* in *run_model.py* file** in code folder



##### The output file named "results.txt" will genarated contaning RNA Sequence, predicted Free residues as 'F' and and Bound residues as 'B' and the propability of being Free for that position.




#### **Incase of any error please check:**
#### This model can take input RNA of length form 18 to 4370.
#### RNA sequence must constitute of  A, U, C, G residues only.
