name: Predicting RNA Site Accessibility using Deep Learning
description: RNA site accessibility plays an essential role in various biological
  processes like ribosome binding, miRNA associated gene regulation, RNA protein interaction
  etc. Experimentally determination of RNA site accessibility is tedious and requires
  much skill. Therefore in this capsule, we tried to pred RNA site accessibility using
  deep learning. This deep learning model constitutes of embedding, CNN and Bidirectional
  GRU layers stacked on top of each other. This model achieves a ROC curve of 0.91.
